# WSL2 Networking

WSL2 VMs run inside a Hyper-V lightweight utility VM that lacks a direct network bridge to the Windows host. The opensuse distro uses a virtual L2 network over AF_VSOCK to provide DNS, DHCP, and NAT between the guest and the host.

## Architecture

The LimaVM controller runs a host-switch goroutine for each WSL2 instance. The guest-side binaries (`network-setup`, `vm-switch`) are baked into the opensuse distro image.

```
Windows Host (RDD process)                    WSL2 VM (opensuse distro)
────────────────────────                      ────────────────────────
host-switch goroutine                         Default namespace
├─ vsock handshake (port 6669) ◄────────────► ├─ network-setup
├─ vsock listener (port 6656)  ◄────────────► │  └─ vsock dial (port 6656)
├─ gvisor-tap-vsock virtual network           │
│  ├─ DNS (*.rancher-desktop.internal)        Isolated network namespace
│  ├─ DHCP (192.168.127.2)                    ├─ vm-switch
│  ├─ NAT (.254 → 127.0.0.1)                 │  ├─ TAP eth0 (192.168.127.2)
│  └─ HTTP API (:80)                          │  └─ udhcpc → DHCP from host
└─ OS syscalls (egress)                       ├─ veth-rd-ns (192.168.143.1)
                                              └─ containers, k3s, etc.
```

### Virtual Network Topology

The virtual network uses the `192.168.127.0/24` subnet:

| Address | Role |
|---------|------|
| `192.168.127.1` | Gateway (host-switch) |
| `192.168.127.2` | TAP device (guest, assigned via DHCP static lease) |
| `192.168.127.254` | Static DNS host (NAT to `127.0.0.1` on host) |

The guest resolves `gateway.rancher-desktop.internal` and `host.rancher-desktop.internal` via DNS zones served by gvisor-tap-vsock.

A veth pair bridges the default WSL namespace (`veth-rd-wsl`, `192.168.143.2`) and the isolated network namespace (`veth-rd-ns`, `192.168.143.1`). All container services run inside the isolated namespace.

## Vsock Handshake Protocol

The host and guest discover each other through a two-phase handshake over AF_VSOCK.

### Phase 1: VM Discovery (port 6669)

Multiple Hyper-V VMs may be running. The host-switch identifies the correct one by exchanging a signature phrase.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant HS as Host-Switch
    participant Reg as Windows Registry
    participant NS as network-setup (guest)

    loop Every 1s until match or timeout
        HS->>Reg: Enumerate running VM GUIDs
        Reg-->>HS: [GUID-A, GUID-B, ...] (may be empty)
        par For each newly-seen GUID
            HS->>NS: Dial vsock port 6669
            NS-->>HS: Send signature phrase
            HS->>HS: Compare signature
        end
    end

    Note over HS: Match found for GUID-A
```

The registry is rescanned every second because `startHostSwitch` runs before the hostagent boots the WSL2 VM. On a fresh system where no other WSL2 distro is running, the utility VM may not yet appear in the registry when the first scan runs.

The signature phrase is `"github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/src/go/networking"`. This is a fixed protocol constant shared between host-switch and the guest's `network-setup` binary. Because the signature is product-wide rather than per-instance, this discovery assumes only one opensuse WSL2 instance runs at a time.

### Phase 2: Data Channel (port 6656)

After identifying the VM, the host-switch creates a listener and signals readiness.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant HS as Host-Switch
    participant NS as network-setup (guest)
    participant VS as vm-switch (guest)

    HS->>HS: Listen on vsock port 6656
    HS->>NS: Dial port 6669, send "READY"
    NS->>NS: Connect to vsock port 6656
    NS->>VS: Spawn vm-switch (pass vsock FD)
    VS->>VS: Create TAP device (eth0)
    VS->>HS: Ethernet frames over vsock
    HS->>VS: Ethernet frames over vsock
```

Ethernet frames use a simple framing protocol: a 2-byte little-endian size prefix followed by the raw frame payload.

## Virtual Network Services

The host-switch creates a [gvisor-tap-vsock](https://github.com/containers/gvisor-tap-vsock) virtual network that provides:

- **DNS**: Resolves `*.rancher-desktop.internal` and `*.docker.internal` zones. Forwards all other queries to the host's DNS resolver.
- **DHCP**: Assigns `192.168.127.2` to the guest's TAP device via a static lease keyed on MAC address `5a:94:ef:e4:0c:ee`.
- **NAT**: Maps `192.168.127.254` to `127.0.0.1`, allowing the guest to reach services bound to localhost on the Windows host.
- **HTTP API**: Listens on `192.168.127.1:80` with endpoints for dynamic port forwarding (`/services/forwarder/expose`, `/services/forwarder/unexpose`, `/services/forwarder/all`).

## Lifecycle Integration

The host-switch goroutine ties into the `LimaVM` controller lifecycle. It starts before the hostagent (because the guest blocks on the vsock handshake during boot) and stops after the hostagent and watcher.

### Normal Start

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R as Reconciler
    participant HS as Host-Switch
    participant HA as Hostagent
    participant G as Guest (opensuse)

    R->>HS: startHostSwitch()
    Note over HS: Begin registry scan + handshake loop
    R->>HA: Start hostagent process
    HA->>G: Boot WSL2 distro
    G->>G: network-setup.service starts (listens on 6669)
    HS->>G: Dial port 6669, read signature
    HS->>G: Dial port 6669, send "READY"
    G->>HS: Data connection (port 6656)
    G->>G: DHCP → 192.168.127.2
    G->>G: Container services start
```

### Normal Stop

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R as Reconciler
    participant HA as Hostagent
    participant W as Watcher
    participant HS as Host-Switch

    R->>HA: Graceful shutdown (SIGINT)
    HA->>HA: Exit
    R->>W: stopWatcher()
    R->>HS: stopHostSwitch()
    HS->>HS: Context cancelled, goroutine exits
```

### Crash Recovery

If the hostagent crashes, the watcher detects the exit and triggers a reconcile. The reconciler tears down the stale host-switch, starts a fresh one, and relaunches the hostagent.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R as Reconciler
    participant W as Watcher
    participant HS as Host-Switch
    participant HA as Hostagent

    HA->>HA: Crash
    W->>R: Enqueue reconcile (phase=Stopped)
    R->>W: stopWatcher()
    R->>HS: stopHostSwitch()
    Note over HS: Goroutine exits
    R->>HS: startHostSwitch() (fresh goroutine)
    R->>HA: Start new hostagent
    Note over HS,HA: New handshake cycle
```

### Control Plane Restart

When the control plane restarts, the host-switch goroutine is gone. The reconciler detects the orphaned hostagent, kills it, and restarts both the host-switch and the hostagent.

### Graceful Shutdown

The `shutdownAllHostagents` runnable stops each host-switch after its hostagent exits.

## Implementation

### Guest-side binaries (in opensuse distro image)

| Binary | Systemd unit | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `network-setup` | `network-setup.service` | Vsock handshake, namespace setup, spawns vm-switch |
| `vm-switch` | (child of network-setup) | TAP device, Ethernet frame relay, DHCP client |
| `wsl-proxy` | (future) | Dynamic port forwarding from guest agent |

### Dependencies

The host-switch uses [gvisor-tap-vsock](https://github.com/containers/gvisor-tap-vsock) for the virtual network stack and [go-winio](https://github.com/microsoft/go-winio) / [virtsock](https://github.com/linuxkit/virtsock) for AF_VSOCK on Windows. All three are direct dependencies; they were previously pulled in transitively via Lima.

## Future Work

- **Kubernetes port forwarding**: Pre-forward `127.0.0.1:<App.Status.KubernetesPort>` to the VM's k3s API server so `kubectl` on the host reaches the K8s API inside the VM. The port is allocated dynamically at `7441 + instance.Index()` and stored in `App.Status.KubernetesPort`.
- **Dynamic port forwarding**: Run `wsl-proxy` in the guest to relay container port mappings from the guest agent to the host-switch's HTTP API.
- **DNS search domains**: Read Windows DNS search domains and pass them to gvisor-tap-vsock's DHCP configuration.
